# Automated-Backup-Software-Python-3

This software is an executable written in Python and subsequently compiled with PyInstaller.

The program itself (all of which works from the command-line interface) once the executable is used.

Allows the user to select one source folder (default (D:/everything)

And then move the files into three folders 
they are designated daily, weekly and monthly backup

meaning that by default, the program will only backup/move the files to the designated daily backup folder
Secondly, the program will check the date, and it will do a weekly backup on the
1st, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th
additionally, on the 1st, the program will do the monthly backup.
